This GitHub repository, created by Nick V. Zorn, is called # spreading-sheet

It contains a workbook that can be used to forecast people's financial lives from "now" through retirement and until death. It has almost every imaginable type of account and debt that one person (or a couple) could have, and it allows the user to program in assumptions about how these things will grow/change. There are three versions - Excel 2013, Excel 2003, and LibreOffice. Click on the one you want, then click the "Download" button on the next page. There are a lot of input parameters, but they're pretty intuitive or easy to look up on your various account statements. There's a README tab in the front that kind of summarizes everything, too.

These workbooks were created in LibreOffice (https://www.libreoffice.org/download/download/), which is a free tool similar to Microsoft Excel. I recommend downloading and installing LibreOffice if you don't have Excel; it's just as good and free.
